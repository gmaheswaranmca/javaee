********Notes********
- Git is a version control system

$git add .					!!! It stages to the git db/repo
$git commit -m "NOTES"		!!! It updates the local repo 
$git push origin main		!!! It uploads to the remote 
$git pull origin main		!!! It downloads from the remote 



$git remote set-url origin https://yourgithubusername:yourpersonalaccesstoken@github.com/yourgithubusername/reponame.git

$git revert 
	!!! undo the "git add"

********Notes on Branches********

To learn
	Branches as a core concept in Git
	Core concepts: the HEAD branch
	Core concepts: local vs. remote branches
	Creating new branches
	Switching branches
	Renaming branches
	Publishing branches !!!NOT DONE
	Tracking branches	!!!NOT DONE
	Pulling + pushing branches	!!!NOT DONE
	Deleting branches
	Merging branches	!!!NOT DONE
	Rebasing branches	!!!NOT DONE
	Comparing branches	!!!NOT DONE

- Branches - the feature makes the Git "more dynamic".

!!!to show all remote and local branch names ->
!!!to show all local branch names:
$git branch

!!!to show all remote branch names:
$git branch -r

!!!To see all local and remote branches: 
$git branch -a

!!!To see detailed information such as 
	the local or remote branches in use, 
	commit ids, and 
	commit message
$git branch -vv 
	or 
$git branch -vva

!!!Creating new branches
!!!To create new branch named "new_branch_name"
$git branch new_branch_name	

!!!To switch Git to branch named "new_branch_name" 
$git checkout new_branch_name

!!!To create new branch named "new_branch_name"
	and
	To switch Git to branch named "new_branch_name"
$git checkout -b new_branch_name

!!!To create new branch named "new_branch_name" 
   not from the current branch
   but from the branch named "specific_different_branch"
		and
   To switch Git to branch named "new_branch_name"
$git checkout -b new_branch_name specific_different_branch

!!! Link to learn more creation options: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/git-create-new-branch

!!!to Delete a Git Branch
$git checkout main
$git branch -d new_branch_name

!!!How To Switch Branch on Git
!!!To switch from current branch to the branch named "new_branch_name"
$git checkout new_branch_name

!!!To switch to the branch named "new_branch_name" Note: Used > Git 2.23 
$git switch new_branch_name


---
!!!How To Rename a Local and Remote Git Branch
!!!To rename the branch name "old_branch_name" to the name "new_branch_name"
	!!!To checkout to the branch "old_branch_name"
$git checkout old_branch_name	
	!!!To Rename to the new name "new_branch_name"
$git branch -m new_branch_name

---
!!!To rename the branch name "old_branch_name" to the name "new_branch_name"
	!!!to switch to main branch 
$git checkout main
	!!!rename the 
$git branch -m old_branch_name new_branch_name

---
!!!To verify the status of the brach which is renamed:
$git branch -a
---

!!!Rename a Remote Git Branch :: Way 1
!!!- There isnâ€™t a way to directly rename a Git branch in a remote repository.
!!!- You have to delete the old branch name at remote, 
!!!- Then push a branch "new branch" to the remote repository
!!! 1.Verify the local branch has the correct name
$git branch -a
!!! 2.Delete the branch old_branch_name at the remote repository
$git push origin --delete old_branch_name
!!! 3. Finally, push the branch with the correct name, and reset the upstream branch:
$git push origin -u new_branch_name

!!!Rename a Remote Git Branch :: Way 2
$git push origin old_branch_name new_branch_name
!!!Resetting the upstream branch is still required:
$git push origin -u new_branch_name
