------------------------------------
	1. JUnit 5 allows to use static imports
	2. JUnit 4 allows annotations to make a method as test case etc
	
*********Junit 4*********
	- JUnit is a test framework 
		which uses annotations 
		to identify methods that specify a test. 
	- JUnit is an open source project hosted at Github.
...
	How to define a test in JUnit?
	- A JUnit test is 
		a method contained in a class 
		which is only used for testing.
	- To define that a certain method is a test method, 
		annotate it with the 
			@Test 
		annotation.
	...
	- This method executes 
		"the code under test". 
	- You use an assert method, provided by JUnit or another assert framework, 
		"to check an expected result versus the actual result". 
	- These method calls are typically called 
			"asserts" or 
			"assert statements".
	...
	- You should provide meaningful messages in assert statements. 
	- That makes it easier for the user to identify and fix the problem. 
	- This is especially true if someone looks at the problem, 
		who did not write the code under test or the test code.
	...

``````````````````````````````Unit Testing```````````````````````````````
	Unit Testing is used 
	"to verify a small chunk of code" 
			by creating 
					a path, 
					function or a method

``````````````````````````````JUnit```````````````````````````````
	- Popular Open Source Java Unit Testing framework 
	- JUnit promotes the idea of “test first, use 'the code' later”				
	...
	for a piece of code 
		- set up the test data
		- test it first 
		- then use it 
	...
	- Major IDEs support JUnit.
	- Open Source Community contributes to the JUnit consistently
	...
	- JUnitEE test framework is used to 
		test within the application server’s container.
	
JUnit rule
		- Annotation is used to define the rule 
		- A test case method must be 
			not static, public, and 
			must return a subtype of TestRule or MethodRule 
		- A JUnit 4 rule is a component 
			that intercepts the test method calls and 
			allows you 
			to perform some action 
				before a test method is run and 
				after a test method has been run.
				
Framework provides the features:
	o Test fixtures
	o Test suites
	o Test runners
	o JUnit classes

Test fixtures	
	- A fixture is 
		a fixed state of a set of objects 
			which is used as a baseline 
			for running the test cases.	
	- The major purpose of a test fixture is 
		to ensure that 
		there is a well-known and fixed environment in which tests are run 
		so that results are repeatable.
	-	setUp() method, 
			which runs before every test invocation. 
			The annotation @Before is used.
	- tearDown() method, 
			which runs after every test method. 
			The annotation @After is used.
	
Test suites
	- If you want to execute multiple test cases in a specific order, 
		it can be done 
		by combining all the test cases in a single origin. 
	- This origin is called the test suites.
	...
	- A test suite bundles a few unit test cases and runs them together.
	...
	- To run the suite test, 
		you need to annotate a class using below-mentioned annotations:
	@Runwith(Suite.class)
	@SuiteClasses(test1.class,test2.class……) or 
	@Suite.SuiteClasses ({test1.class, test2.class……})	
	
Test Runner
	- The test runner is used for executing the test cases.
	...
	- JUnit provides a tool for the execution of the test cases.
	...
	- JUnitCore class is used in order to execute the tests.
	- A method called runClasses 
		which is provided by org.junit.runner.JUnitCore is used 
		to run one or several test cases.
	- The return type of this method is the result object (org.junit.runner.Result), 
		that is used to access information about the tests.	
		
JUnit Classes
	- JUnit classes are used in writing and testing JUnits. 
	Some of the important classes are:
		- Assert: It contains a set of assert methods.
		- TestCase: Contains a test case that defines the fixture to run multiple tests.
		- TestResult: It contains methods in order to collect the results of executing a test case.

``````````````````````````````What is JUnit?```````````````````````````````		
		- JUnit is a unit testing open-source framework for the Java programming language. 
		- Java Developers use this framework to write and execute automated tests. 
		- In Java, there are test cases 
			that have to be re-executed every time a new code is added. 
			This is done to make sure that nothing in the code is broken. 
		...	
		- JUnit has several graphs that represent the progress of a test. 
		- When the test runs smoothly, 
			the graph displays a green color, and 
			it turns red 
			if the test fails. 
		- JUnit Testing enables developers to develop highly reliable and bug-free code.			
		...
		- JUnit plays a huge role when it comes to regression testing. 
		- Regression Testing is a type of software testing 
			that checks 
			if the recent changes made to the code 
				do not adversely affect 
			the previously written code.
		...
		- To have a better answer to the question ‘What is JUnit’, 
			let's have a look at what Unit Testing is.
		...
What is Unit Testing?
		- Unit testing, 
			as the name suggests, 
			refers to the testing of small segments of code. 
		- Here, a unit indicates the smallest bit of code 
			that can be fetched out of the system. 
		- This small bit can be 
			a line of the code, 
			a method, or 
			a class. 
		- The smaller the chunk of code, 
			the better it is, 
			as smaller chunks will tend to run faster. 
		- And this provides 
				o a better insight into the code and 
				o its performance. 
		...
		- When the chunk is small, 
			it is easy to identify the defects from the dormant phase itself. 
		- The developers now spend more time reading the code than writing it. 
		- A successful code  
				o boosts the confidence of the developer and 
				o makes them work better.
		...
What is the need for JUnit Testing?
		The top reasons to take up JUnit Testing are:
		>> To find bugs early in the development phase, 
			which increases the code’s reliability
		>> The framework enables the developer 
			to invest more time in reading the code than writing it
		>> This makes the code more readable, reliable, and bug-free
		>> It boosts the confidence of the developer and motivates them immensely 
		...
Features of JUnit
	There are several features of JUnit that make it so popular. 
	Some of them are as follows:
	######Open Source Network:###### 
	- JUnit is an open-source network 
		that enables developers to write codes fast and with better quality.

	######Provides Annotations:###### 
	- It provides several annotations to identify test methods.

	######Provides Assertions:######
	There are assertions to test expected results.

	######Provides Test Runners:######
	JUnit has test runners to run tests.		
	
	######Improves Code Quality:###### 
	- JUnit is the most popular testing framework for efficient testing. 
	- It allows faster code writing, which results in an increase in the code’s quality. 

	######Automated Test Running:###### 
	- The test results do not require manual checking. 
	- All the tests run automatically on JUnit, 
		the results obtained again automatically checked, and 
		it provides feedback.	
		
	######Easily interpretable results:###### 
	- The test results are represented interactively 
		by showing test progress in a bar, 
		thus making them easily interpretable.
	...
Moving on, let's have a look at JUnit Annotations.		
	- JUnit Annotations refer to 
		the syntactic meta-data added to the Java source code 
		for better structure and readability. 
	- Here, syntactic meta-data refers to 
		the type of data representing the structure of a file 
		with references to bytes, data types, and data structures.
	\\\
	The main point of difference between JUnit4 and JUnit3 is 
	the introduction of  Junit Annotations.
	\\\
	@Test 
		- Tells JUnit 
			which public void method can be run as a test case
	@Before
		- To execute some statement before each test case 
	@After 
		- To execute some statement after each test case 
	@Ignores
		- Used to ignore test cases to get run 
	@BeforeClass
		- Used to execute statement before all test cases 
	@AfterClass
		- Used to execut statement before all test cases 
	@Test(timeOut=500)
		- To set timeout while running test case 
	@Test(expected=IllegalArgumentException.class)
		- To handle some exception during test execution
