For javaee workflow:
	1. Created 
		empty public "git repo"
		at GitHub
	2. Cloned at javaee-02 using "git clone"
	3. Moved the contents of the "javaee-02" to "javaee"
	4. "git reset" is used to set the repo to sync for PAT(personalized access token)
		!!!NOTE: I have configured "git" in my computer longer
	5. ".gitignore" is set to every project folder and 
		at "javaee" folder's ".gitignore" will ignore the eclipse ide related folders 
	6. "git add" to update to stage
